## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My Project idea is to make a web app that users can create/update events in order to keep track of important information in one place.
Events will be able to store information the is relevant to each specific users need. 
If a user plans for a living they can track total costs and how it affects the budget without having to do the math themselves.  
This app is should be simple for people who do small scale planning like host a house party,
and as specific as needed for someone who plans events for their profession.
As well as having a social network to keep involved/prospective parties of events informed.
 
The app will allow for different types of users depending on what they want from the app. 
Like if a professional wants to share important information to the customer but doesn't need to see all the specifics. 
Also people who have specialized skills can have tags that describe their services that can allow them to be hired for events. 
Basically having Professional user accounts and Customer/Personal accounts. 
### Features
Make Events: Create events to a database that hold relevant information for preparing for said event. 
Track Equipment: Keep an inventory of equipment and if equipment not in inventory link to retail links. 
Interact with other Users: Allow parties to share relevant information with each other. 
Dynamically Update Costs to Budget: Math to update budget with costs of workers/equipment and show how much is left before reaching budget.
